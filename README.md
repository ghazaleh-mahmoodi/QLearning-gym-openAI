# QLearning-gym-openAI

Installation
To get started, you’ll need to have Python 3.5+ installed. Simply install gym using pip:

pip install gym
And you’re good to go!

Building from Source
If you prefer, you can also clone the gym Git repository directly. This is particularly useful when you’re working on modifying Gym itself or adding environments. Download and install using:

git clone https://github.com/openai/gym
cd gym
pip install -e .
You can later run pip install -e .[all] to perform a full installation containing all environments. This requires installing several more involved dependencies, including cmake and a recent pip version.
